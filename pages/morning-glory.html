			<h2>Book Reviews</h2>
			<p>&emsp; It takes a writer of talent to make the lives of plain, ordinary people not only interesting but memorable. LaVyrle Spencer accomplishes this in the book that I think is her masterpiece – Morning Glory.</p>
			<h3><i>-By Ellen Micheletti</i></h3>
			<br><br><hr><br>
			<p>&emsp; I truly don’t think I’ve ever loved two characters as much as I love Will and Elly. Both of them are just so real. They each struggle with trauma from the past and now have to survive during a very difficult time in history. Like their lives, their romance is anything but straight forward and easy. There were times that I was screaming (silently in my head) for them to stop being so stupid and realize how much they love each other. This book truly made me feel every emotion.</p>
			<h3><i>-The Book and Beauty Blog</i></h3>
			<br><br><hr><br>
			<p>&emsp; He was a vagrant ex-con; she poor, pregnant and unpretty. Who was the bigger loser?"" There you have the gist of this debut hard-cover romance by the author of such paperback heart palpitators as The Gamble and The Hellion. How do these made-for-each-other losers meet? Simple. The author has her hero, Will Parket, recently released from the pen after serving a sentence for killing a floozy in Texas, answer an ad while passing through the backwater town of Whitney, Georgia.</p>
