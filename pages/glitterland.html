				<p>Glitterland follows Ash Winters, who was once considered the golden boy of the English literary scene but is now a clinically depressed writer of pulp crime fiction. Ash has given up on hope, happiness and most of all— himself. Trapped in a never-ending cycle of his illness, he is constantly haunted by people’s expectations and the inevitable disappointment that comes with not meeting them. Then a chance encounter turns Ash’s world upside down. Darian Taylor is many things—by his own admission, not the sharpest tool in the shed, incredibly charismatic, funny and outgoing—and definitely not one to run when things get tough. Most important of all, he makes Ash laugh. But Ash has spent years living in his own shadow—can he see past it to fight for his own happiness when he thought it irretrievable? <br> Genres: <br>Crime Fiction, Not for Youngsters, Contemporary Romance, Gay Fiction </p>

			<h2>Book Reviews</h2>
			<p>&emsp; It’s hard to believe that this is Hall’s first ever novel considering the emotional punch it packs. The amount of times I had to put down the book because I was so overcome with the indescribably realistic depiction of mental illness is unfathomable to me. Hard-hitting but ultimately uplifting, Glitterland is a complex, emotionally resonant exploration of mental illness, the tenacity it takes to endure life and most of all, a reminder to let people in.</p>
			<h3><i>-Nerd Daily</i></h3>
			<br><br><hr><br>
			<p>&emsp; Hall's command of tropes and ability to consistently deliver explicit writing remain top-notch, but the writing is a bit clumsy compared to recent releases. However, this book has had avid readers for years due to its combination of red-hot sex scenes with genuine emotional connection. The clear content guidance at the start of the book is a grace note that underscores the blunt but sensitive treatment of Ash's mental health.</p>
			<h3><i>-Kirk Reviews</i></h3>
			<br><br><hr><br>
			<p>&emsp; Glitterland is a romance, complete with compelling leads, steamy love scenes, and a hard-won Happy For Now ending. I liked it tremendously. It’s one of the best books I’ve read this summer and, I think, the best debut novel of the year thus far.</p>
