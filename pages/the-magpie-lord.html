				<p>Lucien Vaudrey was put on a boat to China at the age of 17 and made a life there as a trader and smuggler. 20 years later, he is forced to return home to deal with the estate and his new earldom. He is overcome with despair and a lack of will to live and has tried to kill himself several times, but Merrick suggests that there may be some kind of curse involved. Stephen Day owes a favor and agrees to try to figure out what is wrong with Lucien. As they become closer, Stephen is even more determined to save Lucien’s life and catch the warlocks that are behind the evil. The enemies’ magic is incredibly strong, and when they set their full strength against them, Lucien and Stephen may not make it out alive. <br> Genres: <br>Fantasy, Paranormal Romance, Romance, Gay Fiction </p>

			<h2>Book Reviews</h2>
			<p>&emsp; Wow, so this book was such a wonderful surprise, so different from what I was expecting. It combines both the historical and paranormal genres, something very rare, and does it in a way that kept me eagerly turning pages. This is a book that really builds up steam as it goes.  </p>
			<h3><i>-Joyful Jay</i></h3>
			<br><br><hr><br>
			<p>&emsp; The story is set in a Victorian England where the magic is part of everybody’s everyday lives. Not everything is revealed yet as to how this world works, but even in this book I did not feel disoriented in time and place, if that makes sense. I felt that my feet were firmly on the ground and this is how I want to feel when the writer throws me into a world which is at least partially of her own invention</p>
			<h3><i>-Dear Author</i></h3>
			<br><br><hr><br>
			<p>&emsp; I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was the perfect balance of paranormal, murder mystery, and romance. Charles is really good at writing atmospheric settings, and I could feel the cold and the dread of Crane’s ancestral home as Stephen and Crane tried to, well, not die.</p>
