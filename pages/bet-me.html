			<h2>Book Reviews</h2>
			<p>&emsp; Bet Me is both a sentimental and joyful book, a bit of a departure for this author. Crusie’s books are always smart, and always funny, but they aren’t always sweet. This time out, however, Crusie nails both the mental and emotional components of romance to the wall. Her humor is there in full force, as is the sensuality, and yet overarching everything is sort of a fairy-dust happiness. There’s nothing remotely cynical in this book. At its core it is extremely hopeful and romantic.</p>
			<h3><i>-All About Romance</i></h3>
			<br><br><hr><br>
			<p>&emsp; The Steinham line is a great opening to a humorous off beat relationship tale as it distinctly shows the gender differences that help turn this tale into an audaciously delightful screwball comedy. Min is a delightful cynic while Cal is a charming schemer. The support cast including Krispy Crème is an eccentric bunch, but the novel belongs to the lead couple war to implement their respective plan that makes for a fine time for readers who appreciate a wacky romance.</p>
			<h3><i>-by Harriet Klausner</i></h3>
			<br><br><hr><br>
			<p>&emsp; I love the characters, especially Min. She’s a larger woman who dresses conservatively and to hide her body, but who has a flair for awesome shoes. She’s also funny and sweet, and I love that as the book progresses, people are drawn to her when they get to know her.</p>
