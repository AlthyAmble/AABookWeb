				<p>Ishmael is an observant young man from Manhattan who yearns for a whaling adventure. He arrives at the Spouter-Inn in New Bedford, Massachusetts and shares a bed with a Polynesian harpooner named Queequeg. The two soon become friends and sign on with the Pequod in Nantucket. The ship's officers direct the early voyage, with Starbuck, Stubb, and Flask as chief mates. Ahab appears on his quarter-deck and solicits their support in a single purpose for the voyage: hunting down and killing the White Whale. Starbuck resists, but eventually acquiesces. The mystery of the dark figures is explained during the voyage's first chase. Fedallah tells Ahab of a prophecy of his death. Queequeg becomes deathly ill and orders a canoe-shaped coffin from the ship's carpenter. Gams are social meetings of two ships on the open sea, where crews talk of whale sightings and other news. <br> Genres: <br>Nautical Fiction, Adventure, Epic, Adventure Fiction </p>

			<h2>Book Reviews</h2>
			<p>&emsp; But “Moby-Dick” is not a novel. It’s barely a book at all. It’s more an act of transference, of ideas and evocations hung around the vast and unknowable shape of the whale, an extended musing on the strange meeting of human history and natural history. It is, above all, a sui-generis creation, one that came into the world as an unnatural, immaculate conception.</p>
			<h3><i>-by Philip Hoare</i></h3>
			<br><br><hr><br>
			<p>&emsp; While reading “Moby-Dick” is a bit like being stoned, it also evokes an Asperger’s air. Ishmael will tell you everything you wanted to know about the whale, and much that he has made up. “Moby-Dick” stands both as a historical reference for the great age of Yankee whaling and as a work of imagination in which whales become avatars as much as they are real animals.</p>
			<h3><i>-Kirk Reviews</i></h3>
			<br><br><hr><br>
			<p>&emsp; That’s why the book appeals so much to modern artists, like Frank Stella and Matthew Barney. Its oceanic reach and perverse digression provide endless sources of inspiration and interpretation. In chapters such as the famously sublime “The Whiteness of the Whale”—almost hallucinatory in its associative suspension of normality and subtle obscenity</p>
